PATCH VS PUT:
  PATCH is used to apply partial updates to a resource, meaning that only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request body. 
  PUT is used to replace the entire resource with a new representation, meaning that all the fields of the resource are sent in the request body, even if they are not modified.

Idempotent implies that a certain operation can be done many times without changing the result.

HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)
Essentially it means that given an entry point in our REST API, we should be able to discover other resources based only on the server responses.
In other words, whenever the server returns a resource (json or xml), part of the response will contain hyperlinks to other related resources.
