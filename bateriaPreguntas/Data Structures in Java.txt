Arrays, Lists, Sets, Maps, those would be the main interfaces. Then we have implementations like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap. 
And we have the concurrent implementations.  

## PriorityQueue ##
The PriorityQueue is based on the binary heap. 
The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to the natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.  

A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with the heap property, either Min Heap or Max Heap.
Min Heap: the value at the root must be minimum among all values present in Binary Heap. Max Heap is the opposite.
Time complexity of most opererations: O(log N) 


## LinkedList vs ArrayList ##
LinkedList is an ordered collection that consist of independent nodes that are pointing to each other. Every node could be at any memory position, not necessarily consecutive. 
ArrayList is also an ordered collection, but its implemented with an array data structure, meaning its data is stored in consecutive memory blocks.
This two different implementations have pros and cons when it comes to performance and memory usage.
	
>Random Access Search 
- ArrayList has direct references to every element in the list, so it can get the n-th element in constant time. O(1)
- LinkedList has to traverse the list from the beginning to get to the n-th element. O(N)
>Delete 
- ArrayList is slower because once the item is removed, it has to shift the right side of the array to the left. (Unless its removing the last item) O(1) if removes last item, else O(N).
- LinkedList; If the deletion is done using the ListIterator.remove() API, LinkedList just has to manipulate a couple of references O(1); if the deletion is done by value or by index, LinkedList has to potentially scan the entire list first to find the element(s) to be deleted. O(N)
>Insert:
- ArrayList: O(N) because it has to shift the contents of the array to the right. Also, if the array reached maximum size, it has to allocate a bigger array in memory, and copy the contents of the current array to the new one. This is very expensive.
- LinkedList: Also O(N) if you are traversing the list. If you are already at the index where you want to mke the insertion, then its O(1) becuse you only have to manipulate a couple pointers

Also a great video for benchmark: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul4wHrbJ8Fk
Traversing an arrayList is actually much faster than a linked list because of something called pointer chasing.
CPU's have caches (L1,L2,L3). Ideally those caches have data ready before the CPUs require it.
The blocks of main memory are transferred to the caches. Since arraylist contents are all next to each other memory wise, its likely that when the CPU asks for an item,
the cache will have already brought the following items.
This is not the case for linked lists because the contents can be at any memory position, you have to point one node after the other to traverse the hole list, and this is pointer chasing.

## Set interface ##
This interface doesn't guarantee order, but it guarantees uniqueness.
Para un Set ordenado, hay subinterfaces de Set como SortedSet, con implementaciones como TreeSet y LinkedHashSet.
	     Performance and Speed : First difference between comes in terms of speed. HashSet is fastest, LinkedHashSet is second on performance or almost similar to HashSet but TreeSet is bit slower because of 
             sorting operation it needs to perform on each insertion. TreeSet provides guaranteed O(log(n)) time for common operations like add, remove and contains, while HashSet and LinkedHashSet offer constant time 
             performance e.g. O(1) for add, contains and remove given hash function uniformly distribute elements in bucket.
             Ordering : HashSet does not maintain any order while LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order of elements much like List interface and TreeSet maintains sorting order or elements.

# HashSet
HashSet is implemented using a hash table. Elements are not ordered. The add, remove, and contains methods have constant time complexity O(1).

# Tree Set
TreeSet is implemented using a tree structure(red-black tree). The elements are sorted, but the add, remove, and contains methods has time complexity O(log (n)). 
It offers several methods to deal with the ordered set like first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet()
It can provide order either by providing a Comparator on the constructor, or by implementing the Comparable interface and implementing the CompareTo method.
TreeSet uses equals() to determine whether an object can be added or not in the set (as Set maintains collection of unique objects) and comparable/ Comparator to determine the order in which the objects are to be added.
It doesn't use hashcode.

# HashSet VS TreeSet
1) Performance: HashSet is faster than TreeSet and should be preferred choice if sorting of elements is not required.
2) HashSet allows null objects but TreeSet doesn't and throws NullPointerException, because TreeSet uses compareTo() method to compare keys, and if one of the keys is null the exception will occur.
3) HashSet is backed by HashMap while TreeSet is backed by NavigableMap in Java.
4) HashSet uses equals() method to compare two object in Set and for detecting duplicates while TreeSet uses compareTo() method for same purpose. if equals() and compareTo() are not consistent, i.e. for two equal object equals should return true while compareTo() should return zero, than it will break contract of Set interface and will allow duplicates in Set implementations like TreeSet
5) Now most important difference between HashSet and TreeSet is ordering. HashSet doesn't guaranteed any order while TreeSet maintains objects in Sorted order defined by either Comparable or Comparator method in Java.


# LinkedHashSet
LinkedHashSet is an extended version of HashSet. HashSet doesn’t follow any order where as LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order.
HashSet uses HashMap object internally to store it’s elements where as LinkedHashSet uses LinkedHashMap object internally to store and process it’s elements.

$ LinkedHashMap
It is the same as HashMap with an additional feature that it maintains insertion order.
Every node has two pointers, before and after, simulating a doubly linked list.
LinkedHashMap will take more memory than HashMap. 
Each entry in a normal HashMap just has the key and the value. 
Each LinkedHashMap entry has those references and references to the next and previous entries.

## Map ##
a1. equals y hashcode:
	If two objects are equal according to equals() method, then their hash code must be same. 
	If two objects hashcode is the same, they are not necessarilly equals()
a2. como implementar un hashcode y un equals.
a3. sabes las diferencias entre map, hashmap, hashtable, treemap, concurrentHashMap y linkedHashmap?
a4. Cual de estas key es mejor para un HashMap? (String, Integer, Double)
 - String, porque String es inmutable, y java cachea el hashcode, de manera que no tiene que calcular el hashcode en cada busqueda
