Docker: Containerization platform that combinines all our apps and dependencies in one package(container) so it can be run in any environment.
Docker uses the underlying OS to function, thats why its lightweight.
Hypervirsor technologies create their own OS on top of the existing OS, which makenm them heavy.

Docker Image: A file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker container.

Docker container: A runtime instance of a docker image. we can start a container running docker run -t -i command image_name

Docker Swarm: A technology used to orchestrate docker containers, like kubernetes. However kubernetes provides more features:
Kubernetes can create and manage Docker containers, schedule them to run on the appropriate nodes in a cluster, and automatically scaling, manage the storage and networking of Docker containers, self-healing, etc.

Dockerfile: A file that contains specific instructions that we pass on to docker so that it creates a docker image.

Docker Compose: Tool to define multiple containers and their configs via yaml or json. Usually used in development to define many dependencies required by our apps, like kafka, mysql, redis, etc.
